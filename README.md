### 1. Intvervall Calculator

Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
Intervals can "touch", such as [0, 1] and [1, 2], but they won't be considered overlapping. For example, given the intervals (7, 9), (2, 4), (5, 8), return 1 as the last interval can be removed and the first two won't overlap. The intervals are not necessarily sorted in any order.

## Valid IP Adress Finder

Given a string of digits, generate all possible valid IP address combinations. IP addresses must follow the format A.B.C.D, where A, B, C, and D are numbers
between 0 and 255. Zero-prefixed numbers, such as 01 and 065, are not allowed, except for 0 itself.

For example, given "2542540123", you should return ['254.25.40.123','254.254.0.123'].
